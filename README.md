# POKESWAP
Pokéswap is a database designed to streamline the trading experience for Pokémon card fans. We aim to create a database to assist users with a comprehensive tool to manage and view their card collections, create trade offers, and comment on other collectors’ posts in a seamless manner. Users can easily upload and sort through their personal Pokémon card collections, as well as view other’s collections. The database is designed to model several aspects of the card trading domain, including users, cards of a user, and details of a specific card, including collector number, pokémon number, type, and other specifications of the card. This application domain is perfect as a CPSC 304 project since it focuses on designing a relational database to manage complex relationships between users, their card collections, trade offers, and post-interactions. It provides opportunities to explore database indexing, querying, and management – all essential concepts covered in CPSC 304.
